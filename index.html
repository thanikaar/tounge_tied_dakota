    <div>*im not actually sad. not anymore. this idea of a ‘sad girl’ i feel has just been so over romanticized by the media that i found myself writing it before even thinking. the sadness i feel now, if you can even call it that, is a feeling of guilt. i feel guilty when i try to find stillness (i fail due to the guilt). i feel guilty when i go on walks. i feel guilty when i cook food. i feel guilty when i go on trips. i feel guilty when i go to the movies. All in all, i feel guilty when i try to do something i enjoy (the only time i don't feel guilty when doing something i enjoy is when i'm writing). i dont know why and i dont like it. i hope it is just a phenomenon that happens to people entering their 20s. i hope it’ll go away soon.</div>
